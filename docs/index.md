## Purpose

This document serves as the complete  definition of the Deep Dive Coding Java + Android Bootcamp standards for Java and SQL source code, as well as XML and JSON documents. A Java, SQL, XML, or JSON source file may be described as being  "in DDC Java + Android Style" **if and only** if it adheres to the rules stated or referenced herein.

## Usage

Many of the rules stated or referenced here are applied by the IntelliJ IDEA **Code/Reformat code** command with the [IntelliJ scheme]((https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/styleguide/gh-pages/intellij-java-google-style.xml)) included in the [Google Style Guide repository](https://github.com/google/styleguide) is installed. However, not all rules are applied in this fashion: in particular, **Code/Reformat code** does not enforce naming or general structure/sequence conventions, and it does not remove many instances of extra vertical whitespace. In any given instance where a stated rule is not applied by this command, that _does not_ excuse the student from following that rule. Similarly, if some example or starter code provided by an instructor (or anyone else) is not conformant with this style guide, that does not excuse the student from the conformance requirement. 

Please note that most of the rules in this style guide are strict but narrow; that is, for any non-trivial processing task, there is a wide range of expressions that implement the given task and still conform to the rules of this style guide.

Note: Words and phrases like "**must**", "**must not**", "**do**", "**do not**", etc., written in bold type (excluding the headings, which are also in bold type), indicate strict rules of this style guide. _Italicized_ words and phrases indicate recommendations or qualifications/clarifications of rules.
